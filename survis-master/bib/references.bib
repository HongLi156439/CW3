  abstract = {Data mining approach can be used to discover knowledge by analyzing the patterns or correlations among of fields in large databases. Data mining approach was used to find the patterns of the data from Tanzania Ministry of Water. It is used to predict current and future status of water pumps in Tanzania. The data mining method proposed is XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting). XGBoost implement the concept of Gradient Tree Boosting which designed to be highly fast, accurate, efficient, flexible, and portable. In addition, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) is also proposed to select the important features of the data to obtain an accurate model. The best accuracy achieved with using 27 input factors selected by RFE and XGBoost as a learning model. The achieved result show 80.38 percents in accuracy. The information or knowledge which is discovered from data mining approach can be used by the government to improve the inspection planning, maintenance, and identify which factor that can cause damage to the water pumps to ensure the availability of potable water in Tanzania. Using data mining approach is cost-effective, less time consuming and faster than manual inspection.}

      abstract = {Water crisis is a crucial concern around the globe. Appropriate and timely maintenance of water pumps in drought-hit countries is vital for communities relying on the well. In this paper, we analyze and apply a sequential attentive deep neural architecture, TabNet, for predicting water pump repair status in Tanzania. The model combines the valuable benefits of tree-based algorithms and neural networks, enabling end-to-end training, model interpretability, sparse feature selection, and efficient learning on tabular data. Finally, we compare the performance of TabNet with popular gradient tree-boosting algorithms like XGBoost, LightGBM,CatBoost, and demonstrate how we can further uplift the performance by choosing focal loss as the objective function while training on imbalanced data.}

  abstract = {Pipe breaks in urban water distribution network lead to significant economical and social costs, putting the service quality as well as the profit of water utilities at risk. To cope with such a situation, scheduled preventive maintenance is desired, which aims to predict and fix potential break pipes proactively. Physical models developed for understanding and predicting the failure of pipes are usually expensive, thus can only be used on a limited number of trunk pipes. As an alternative, statistical models that try to predict pipe breaks based on historical data are far less expensive, and therefore have attracted a lot of interests from water utilities recently. In this paper, we report a novel data mining prediction system that has been built for a water utility in a big Chinese city. Various aspects of how to build such a system are described, including problem formulation, data cleaning, model construction, as well as evaluating the importance of attributes according to the requirements of end users in water utilities. Satisfactory results have been achieved by our prediction system. For example, with the system trained on the available dataset at the end of 2010, the water utility would avoid 50 percent of pipe breaks in 2011 by examining only 6.98 percent of its pipes in advance. During the construction of the system, we find that the extremely skew distribution of break and non-break pipes, interestingly, is not an obstacle. This lesson could serve as a practical reference for both academical studies on imbalanced learning as well as future explorations on pipe failure prediction problems.}

The second part describes the construction and validation of six ANN models. After a discussion of the performances of these models, they are used for the prediction of water mains failure and the determination of the benefit index, which allows optimization of investment for the rehabilitation and maintenance of urban water mains. The spatial repartition of the risk of degradation is illustrated using a geographic information system, which constitutes an effective tool for the elaboration of strategies of rehabilitation of water distribution systems.}

  abstract = {This paper demonstrates the application of data mining techniques to predict river water quality index. The usefulness of these techniques lies in the automated extraction of novel knowledge from the data to improve decision-making. The popular classification techniques, namely k-nearest neighbor, decision trees, Naive Bayes, artificial neural networks, rule-based and support vector machines were used to develop the predictive environment to classify water quality into understandable terms based on the Overall Index of Pollution. Experimentation was conducted on two types of data sets: synthetic and real. A repeated k-fold cross-validation procedure was followed to design the learning and testing frameworks of the predictive environment. Based on the validation results, it was found that the error rate in defining the true water quality class was 20 and 28 percent, 11 and 24 percent, 1 and 38 percent and 10 and 20 percent for the k-nearest neighbor, Naive Bayes, artificial neural network and rule-based classifiers for synthetic and real data sets, respectively. The decision tree and support vector machines classifiers were found to be the best predictive models with 0 percent error rates during automated extraction of the water quality class. This study reveals that data mining techniques have the potential to quickly predict water quality class, provided data given are a true representation of the domain knowledge.}

  abstract = {The quality of surface waters plays a key role in the sustainability of ecological systems. Measuring water quality parameters (WQPs) is of high importance in the management of surface water resources. In this paper, contemporary-developed regression analysis was proposed to estimate the hard-to-measure parameters from those that can be measured easily. To this end, we proposed a novel modification of support vector regression (SVR), known as multiple-kernel support vector regression (MKSVR) algorithm. The MKSVR learns an optimal data representation for regression analysis by either linear or nonlinear combination of some precomputed kernels. For solving the optimization problem of the MKSVR, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was used. The proposed algorithm was assessed using WQPs taken from Karun River, Iran. MKSVR was used to estimate chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) using nine WQPs as the input variables, namely electrical conductivity, sodium, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, nitrite, nitrate nitrogen, turbidity, and pH. The results of the proposed MKSVR were compared with those obtained using the SVR and Random Forest regression (RFR). The results showed that the MKSVR algorithm (correlation coefficient [R] = 0.8 and root mean squared error [RMSE] = 4.76 mg/l) increased the accuracy level of BOD prediction when compared with SVR (R = 0.68 and RMSE = 5.15 mg/l) and RFR (R = 0.77 and RMSE = 5.15 mg/l). In the case of COD estimation, the performance of a developed support vector machine (SVM) technique was satisfying. Overall, the use of MKSVR along with the PSO algorithm could demonstrate the superiority of the newly developed SVM technique for the WQPs estimation in the natural streams.}

  abstract = {The objectives of this study were to predict the water quality index using Support Vector Machine (SVM) model and to identify the most important attributes affecting the variability of the water quality index in the Sefidrud basin which is located in the northern part of Iran. Water samples at each site have been collected monthly from December 2007 to November 2008. At each station, water samples were collected from inside the middle of the river by means of a plastic bucket and were transported to the laboratory. Water quality parameters were measured, calculated and classified according to the standard methods. Prediction of the SVM models in the study area resulted in determination coefficient and root mean square error of 0.87 and 0.061 for the water quality index, respectively. The nitrate was identified as the most important attribute influencing the water quality index. Overall, our results indicated that the SVM models could explain 87 percent of the total variability in water quality index. Besides, the predictability of water quality index could be improved by other statistical and intelligent models. These predictions help us to improve river management, regarding water quality.

  abstract = {Water quality monitoring programs are essential planning and management tools, but they face many challenges in the developing world. The scarcity of financial and human resources and the unavailability of infrastructure often make it impossible to meet the legal requirements of water monitoring. Many approaches to optimizing water quality monitoring programs have already been proposed. However, few investigations have developed and tested data mining for this purpose. This article has developed data-based models to reduce the number of water quality parameters of monitoring programs using data mining. The objective was to extract patterns from the database, expressed by association rules, which together with field parameters, measured with automatic probes, can estimate laboratory variables. This approach was applied in 35 monitoring stations along 27 river basins throughout Brazil. The data are from fifty years of monitoring (1971–2021), constituting 6328 observations of 60 water quality parameters investigated in different environmental contexts, water quality, and the structuring of monitoring programs. With the applied approach it was possible to estimate 56 percent of the laboratory parameters in the monitoring stations investigated. The influence of environmental characteristics on the optimization capacity of monitoring programs was evident. The methodology used was not influenced by different water quality levels and anthropogenic impacts. However, the number of parameters was the most influential element in optimization. Monitoring programs with 20 or more water quality variables have the highest potential (≥44 percent) of optimization by this methodology. Results demonstrate that this approach is a promising alternative that can reduce the frequency of analyses measured in the laboratory and increase the spatial and temporal coverage of water quality monitoring networks.}

    abstract = { Closed-circuit television inspections of sewer condition deterioration as required for proactive management are expensive and hence limited to portions of a sewer network. The data mining approach presented herein is shown capable of unlocking information contained within inspection records and enhances existing pipe inspection practices currently used in the wastewater industry. Predictive models developed using the random forests algorithm are found capable of predicting individual sewer pipe condition so that uninspected pipes in a sewer network with the greatest likelihood of being in a structurally defective condition state are identified for future rounds of inspection. Complications posed by imbalance between classes common within inspection datasets are overcome by first establishing the classification task in a binary format (where pipes are in either good or bad structural condition) and then using the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve to establish alternative cutoffs for the predicted class probability. The random forests algorithm achieved a stratified test set false negative rate of 18\ percent, false positive rate of 27\ percent and an excellent area under the ROC curve of 0.81 in a case study application to the City of Guelph, Ontario, Canada. The novel inclusion of condition information of pipes attached at either the upstream or downstream manholes of an individual pipe enhances the predictive power for bad pipes representing the minority class of interest (reducing the false negative rate to 11\ percent, reducing the false positive rate to 25\ percent and increasing the area under the ROC curve to 0.85). An area under the ROC curve >0.80 indicates random forests are an "excellent" choice for predicting the condition of individual pipes in a sewer network. }

Modeling pump system performance in terms of the energy consumption and pumped wastewater flow rate based on industrial data with neural networks is examined. A bi-objective optimization model incorporating data-driven components is formulated to minimize the energy consumption and maximize the pumped wastewater flow rate. An adaptive mechanism is developed to automatically determine weights associated with two objectives by considering the wet well level and influent flow rate. The optimization model is solved by an artificial immune network algorithm. A comparative analysis between the optimization results and the observed data is performed to demonstrate the improvement of the pumping system performance. Results indicate that saving energy while maintaining the pumping performance is potentially achievable with the proposed data-driven framework.}
